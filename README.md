C# Training Module.
Here I will upload materials and codes on a daily basis that I am following to learn .net core to ASP .net

C# is a powerful programming language
with C# we can build any software
Whether its
1. Desktop Application
2. Mobile Application
3. Web Application
4. Games
5. Artificial Intelligence etc.
Anything

Unfortunately, we don't learn about C# in our academics. Most of the universities don't focus on this.
It is mostly used in enterprises or industries.

I learned how powerful C# is after I joined Ding.
So I started to learn it. This is the basics of C# which I am learning from freecodecamp.

After this, I will switch to advanced C# or .net will create a repository for that as well.
